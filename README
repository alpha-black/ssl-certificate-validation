Library used - Openssl. The pragma is to ignore depcrecated warning in OS X.

for Openssl).

For manually validating hostname [2].

To compile,
gcc -o validate ssl_cert_verification.c -lcrypto -lssl -g

Compiled and tested in brute.aalto.fi.

Code explanation from main:
1. initialize the SSL libraries using the Openssl library functions.
2. Load the local CA certs from /etc/ssl/certs/ and set the peer verification method.
3. Create a TCP socket with hostname and portnumber passed.
4. Use BIO for linking SSL to the TCP socket and initiate the handshake.
5. Use the in-built function (SSL_get_verify_result) to validate the peer certificate.
    If no error, manually extract the SAN and validate with the hostname. 
    The program only checks for characters to the right of
    '*' if present in the DNS name. All string after all '*' are checked if they are
    present in hostname.
6. If the certificates are valid, do a HTTP GET and print the response.
